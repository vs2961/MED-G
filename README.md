# Setting up your environment

You will need Node.js, pnpm, and Python installed on your computer.

After cloning the repo, create a python virtual environement with `python3 -m venv venv`.

Install dependencies with `pnpm i`.

To run the app, enter the virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate` from within the root directory of the repo and then `pnpm dev`. 

Shreyas: For windows, `run pnpm dev-w` instead to run the code.
